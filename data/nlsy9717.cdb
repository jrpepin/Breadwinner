Truncated values are applied to the top 2 percent of respondents with valid 
non-missing responses.  The lowest value for the top 2 percent of cases is used 
as the truncation level ($14,048 for this variable).  Values for all cases at or
over that level are averaged. That average is then assigned to each of the top 2
percent of the cases.

Truncated values are applied to the top 2 percent of respondents with valid 
non-missing responses.  The lowest value for the top 2 percent of cases is used 
as the truncation level ($3,840 for this variable).  Values for all cases at or 
over that level are averaged. That average is then assigned to each of the top 2
percent of the cases.

over that level are averaged. That average is then assigned to each of the top 2
percent of the cases.

Truncated values are applied to the top 2 percent of respondents with valid 
non-missing responses.  The lowest value for the top 2 percent of cases is used 
as the truncation level ($2,562 for this variable).  Values for all cases at or 
over that level are averaged. That average is then assigned to each of the top 2
percent of the cases.

Truncated values are applied to the top 2 percent of respondents with valid 
non-missing responses.  The lowest value for the top 2 percent of cases is used 
as the truncation level ($23,000 for this variable).  Values for all cases at or
over that level are averaged. That average is then assigned to each of the top 2
percent of the cases.

Truncated values are applied to the top 2 percent of respondents with valid 
non-missing responses.  The lowest value for the top 2 percent of cases is used 
as the truncation level ($8,000 for this variable).  Values for all cases at or 
over that level are averaged. That average is then assigned to each of the top 2
percent of the cases.

Truncated values are applied to the top 2 percent of respondents with valid 
non-missing responses.  The lowest value for the top 2 percent of cases is used 
as the truncation level ($ 35,000 for this variable).  Values for all cases at 
or over that level are averaged. That average is then assigned to each of the 
top 2 percent of the cases.

Truncated values are applied to the top 2 percent of respondents with valid 
non-missing responses.  The lowest value for the top 2 percent of cases is used 
as the truncation level ($ 100,000 for this variable).  Values for all cases at 
or over that level are averaged. That average is then assigned to each of the 
top 2 percent of the cases.

Truncated values are applied to the top 2 percent of respondents with valid 
non-missing responses.  The lowest value for the top 2 percent of cases is used 
as the truncation level ($ 80,471 for this variable).  Values for all cases at 
or over that level are averaged. That average is then assigned to each of the 
top 2 percent of the cases.

Truncated values are applied to the top 2 percent of respondents with valid 
non-missing responses.  The lowest value for the top 2 percent of cases is used 
as the truncation level ($ 147,286 for this variable).  Values for all cases at 
or over that level are averaged. That average is then assigned to each of the 
top 2 percent of the cases.

as the truncation level ($ 90,000 for this variable).  Values for all cases at 
or over that level are averaged. That average is then assigned to each of the
