The purpose of this analysis of the NLSY97 data is to describe mothers' odds of 
breadwinning by 8 years after mothers' first birth.  
  
DATA
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The description of the variables can be found online, 
using the [NLS Investigator](https://www.nlsinfo.org/investigator/pages/search.jsp?s=NLSY97).
  
The data for this analysis can be accessed by logging into the NLS Investigator,
selecting the NLSY97 study and NLSY97 1997-2017 (rounds 1-18) substudy.  

To select the variables for this study, researchers should select ["Choose Tagsets"](https://www.nlsinfo.org/content/access-data-investigator/investigator-user-guide/choose-tagsets-tab)
and upload the file: "$data/nlsy9717.NLSY97."  

To download the data, select "Save/Download" and then "Advanced Download." 
Make sure "Tagset" and "STATAÂ® dictionary file of selected variables" are selected.  
Give your download a filename (e.g. "nlsy9717") and click download.  

Before running the first .do file (01_nlsy97_sample & demo), remove the comment 
markers in the downloaded "value-labels" .do file so that variables are renamed.   
We also had to delete all instances of "KEY!" so the file import will run properly.

Environment
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Users need to create a personal setup file before running these scripts.
Use the setup_example.do script located in the NLSY97 sub-folder as a template and 
save the customized file in this sub-folder.
