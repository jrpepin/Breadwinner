files nlsy97_hhX0_pred.do and nlsy97_hhX0_stata_pred.do are older versions of nlsy97_bw_estimates_hhX0.do
They are in this archive so that they don't get completely deleted from the repository, 
but it would have been better (maybe?) if we had used git mv to rename the file to
keep the relationships among files clearer in there repository (without this note)
