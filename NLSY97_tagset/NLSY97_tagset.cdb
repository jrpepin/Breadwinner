Truncated values are applied to the top 2 percent of respondents with valid 
non-missing responses.  The lowest value for the top 2 percent of cases is used 
as the truncation level ($ 145,000 for this variable).  Values for all cases at 
or over that level are averaged. That average is then assigned to each of the 
top 2 percent of the cases.
