Data
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This repository estimates mothers' breadwinning using the SIPP14 and the NLSY97.

SIPP14: We use waves 1-4 of the [2014 SIPP data files](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/sipp/data/datasets.html).

NLSY97: We use rounds 1-18 (1997-2017) of the [1997 NLSY data](https://www.nlsinfo.org/investigator/pages/search.jsp?s=NLSY97).

More information about the downloading the data can be found in the corresponding 
README files located in the SIPP and NLSY97 sub-folders.

Environment
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Users need to create two personal setup files before running these scripts.
Use the setup_example.do scripts located in the SIPP and NLSY97 sub-folders as a template and save each of these customized files in the corresponding sub-folder.

Analysis
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To run all of the project code, run the breadwinner.do file.

If the NLSY and SIPP scripts are run separatly, the NLSY sripts should be run first.
